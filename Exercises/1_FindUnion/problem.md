# Problem statement
You are given an two dimensional array of bools A[N][N]. Player starts from given position (x,y), for which A[x][y] = true. From such position he can only move to other position such that it's coordinates differ by 1 in one dimension and it's value in A is true.
Write a function, that returns the number of positions that a player can reach from (x,y).
